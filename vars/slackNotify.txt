<strong>slackNotify(buildStatus='STARTED')</strong>

<p>
    Sends notifications via Slack and email.
    Defaults the sending "Started" notification.
    Pass the build status string and customize the notifications based on status.

    If you don't supply a change set string, the plugin will look for a GIT_CHANGE_LOG environment variable, which can be supplied in your environment step via gitChangeLog()
